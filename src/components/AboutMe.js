        <h3>Hey there, ðŸ‘‹</h3>
        I'm <span>Tejas</span>, a second-year undergrad at <span>Scaler School of Technology, Bengaluru</span>. I specialize in building websites that prioritize responsiveness, accessibility, and aesthetics. While I started my journey in <span>frontend development,</span> I've discovered a passion for <span>backend technologies</span> and thrive on the challenges of working with databases, servers, and APIs. I love the challenge of building efficient and scalable backend systems.
        <br /> <br />
        I'm always eager for <span>new opportunities</span> to create awesome software solutions. Letâ€™s team up and craft something amazing.
        <br /> <br />
        Beyond coding, you'll often find me hanging out with my friends on trips, exploring new places and making memories. I also love watching animeâ€”itâ€™s my go-to for unwinding and getting lost in a creative world.
        <br /> <br />
