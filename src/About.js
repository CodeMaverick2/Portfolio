                    <p>My name's Tejas. I'm a First year undergrad at Scaler School of Technology.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        During the day I work as a lead developer at a local agency 
                        and in the evening I  work on freelance projects and utilize 
                        the time to built my own products. I spent my leisure hours 
                        writing articles and poetry. Right now I'm also trying a hand
                        at machine learning and AI. I love to learn and explore new arenas.
